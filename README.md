# Real Estate APIs in Django REST

## Introduction

This project provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing real estate listings, properties, and related data using the Django REST framework. Whether you're building a real estate website or need to integrate real estate functionality into an existing application, these APIs will help you achieve your goals efficiently.

## Features

- **Property Listings**: Create, read, update, and delete property listings.

- **Property Details**: Retrieve detailed information about individual properties.

- **User Authentication**: Secure endpoints with user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- **User Management**: Register users, login, and manage user profiles.

- **Property Search**: Search for properties based on various criteria like location, price, and property type.

- **Favorites**: Allow users to save their favorite properties.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python**: Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Django**: Install Django using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install Django
   ```

3. **Django REST Framework**: Install the Django REST framework:

   ```bash
   pip install djangorestframework
   ```

4. **Django Rest Framework Simple JWT**: Install JWT support:

   ```bash
   pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
   ```

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd real-estate-apis-django-rest
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the admin panel by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials created earlier.

2. To interact with the APIs, use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/). Refer to the API documentation or OpenAPI schema provided for detailed endpoint information.

3. Users can register, log in, and start using the APIs to manage property listings, search for properties, and save favorites.

## Customization

This project serves as a foundation for building real estate-related applications. You can customize it in various ways:

- **Models**: Extend or modify the existing models to include additional property details or custom features.

- **Permissions**: Customize permissions to control who can access and modify data.

- **Views and Serializers**: Create new views and serializers to expand the functionality of the APIs.

- **Frontend Integration**: Integrate the APIs into your frontend application using popular JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## Deployment

When deploying this project for production, consider using a production-ready database like PostgreSQL, configuring environment variables for sensitive information, and securing your API endpoints properly.
